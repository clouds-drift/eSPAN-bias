# eSPAN-bias
Bias calculation for eSPAN experiments

eSPAN (enrichment and sequencing of protein associated nascent DNA) method is able to analyze the enrichment of proteins of interest, including histones and its modifications, at replicating chromatin in a strand-specific manner in mammalian cells. Strand specific read coverage on plus and minus strands can be calculated from the clean bam file by [deeptools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamCoverage.html). Then read coverage bias can be analyzed by 'eSPAN-bias' scripts.
